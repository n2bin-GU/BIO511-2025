    "text": "1 Introduction\nThis tutorial is to take you through the final steps of setting up and accessing the c3se High Performance Computing infrastructure. The specific cluster we will use is called Vera. You will be introduced to this cluster in the lecture and here you can find more information about it, including what resources that are available, how to run jobs and other documentation.\nWe will walk you through step by step in this tutorial so that we (hopefully) can assist if there are any problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-course setup\n\n\n\nTo be able to follow these steps you first have to have followed the steps of the Pre-course Setup including registration at SUPR and application to the course HPC project.\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Adding Vera/c3se at SUPR\n\nLog in to SUPR\nClick “Accounts” in the left side menu\nRequest access to Vera/c3se\n\n\n\n\n3 Setting up a Chalmers ID\n\nNavigate to https://myaccount.chalmers.se/.\nLog in with your GU account.\nChoose “Activate CID” and follow the instructions to activate your account\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember your password!\n\n\n\nThe CID username and password are the ones you will use to log in to the cluster\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Setting up Chalmers VPN\nTo be able to access c3se from other networks than in GU or Chalmers, you will need a Chalmers VPN\n\nNavigate to https://chalmers.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/detail/knowledgeitem?unid=07e6154089a648d09711ccc42a42fc88\nFollow the instructions to set up the Chalmers VPN\n\n\n\n\n5 Connecting to the HPC using ssh in VSCode\nTo be able to connect to the HPC in a manner that will let you use the full suite of tools available (or most of them at least) in VSCode, you will need to install the Remote - SSH extension.\n\nOpen VSCode\nGo to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+X\nSearch for “Remote - SSH” and install the extension by Microsoft (if youre unsure how install extensions, see here)\nAfter installation, you will see a new icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window. Click on it to open the Remote Explorer view.\n\nIf the SSH Targets are not visible, click on the drop down to expand the view\n\nClick on the + (“New Remote”) icon next to SSH header to add a new SSH host\nIn the input box that appears, enter the SSH connection string for Vera: &lt;your_chalmers_id&gt;@vera1.c3se.chalmers.se (replace &lt;your_chalmers_id&gt; with your actual Chalmers ID)\nPress Enter to confirm\nYou will be prompted to select the SSH configuration file to update. Choose the default option (usually ~/.ssh/config)\n\nOnce you have added the SSH host, you can connect to Vera:\n\nIn the Remote Explorer view, find the Vera entry under SSH Targets (or by clicking on the blue “remote window” icon in the bottom left corner of VSCode)\n\nClick on the “Connect to Host” icon (an arrow if you want the same window, square if you want a new one) next to the Vera entry\nIf you clicked on the blue “remote window” icon, select “Remote-SSH: Connect to Host…” and then select the Vera entry\n\nA new VSCode window will open, and you will be prompted to enter your Chalmers ID password\nAfter entering your password, you should be connected to Vera, and you can start working on the HPC cluster directly from VSCode. Make sure that you open your home folder on Vera to open up a workspace.\nYou can verify that you are connected to Vera by opening a new terminal in VSCode (Terminal &gt; New Terminal) and checking the hostname in the terminal prompt. It should show something like your_chalmers_id@vera:~$",

    "text": "Doing bioinformatics often necessitates the handling of very large files, with complex structure and dense matrices. This makes them often unwieldy to pretty much impossible to handle in traditional GUI-based analysis tools (such as Excel), and as such we rely on original and lightweight file handling systems such as bash-based command line enviroments that allow us to interact with our computer on a more fundamental level.\nTypically the first thing you encounter on opening a new terminal instance is:\nuser@computer:~$\nThis is the terminal prompt where you’ll be able to issue commands to the computer, with the syntax (“grammar” of the code) of your command prompts often using the following structure:\nuser@computer:-$ command -option my_object\n\n# or you may have more advanced command prompts\n\nuser@computer:-$ command -threads 2 -output $My_Directory_Variable/ -prefix New_file_ -accessoryfile Additional_file my_object | nextcommand -cvfz New_file_my_object.tar.gz\nImagination (and resources, time complexity, optimization…) sets the limit of what you can do in the CLI\nIf you’re further curious on the history of shell and the command line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\nBy the end of this practical, you should be able to:\n\nNavigate the file system using cd and ls\nCreate and manipulate directories with mkdir\nCreate, copy, move, and delete files using touch, cp, mv, and rm\nView file contents using cat, head, and tail\nSearch within files using grep\nDisplay text using echo\nTie these commands together using pipes",

However, awk is much more powerful text manipulation tool that allows us to do advanced language processing and data extraction not to dissimilar to a programming language. Using awk we can accomplish short programming tasks directly in the command line.\n\nawk (Aho, Weinberger, and Kernighan): Allows for advanced text processing and file manipulation\n\nSome key commands:\n\n-F: Specifies the input field separator (default is whitespace)\nBEGIN{}: Block of programming that runs before processing any input lines (before text is put into $1, $2, etc)\nEND{}: Block that runs after processing all input lines (after all text has been processed)\n{}: Block that runs for each input line (used for processing)\n$1, $2, ...: Represents the first, second, etc. fields (eg. columns) in the current line\nOFS: Output field separator (default is a space, can be set in BEGIN block)\n\nExercises\n# awk is great for quick column selection and simple filtering\n# The syntax is 'awk option 'program' input-file' where program is a series of commands\n# Print seqid and type columns of a gff file\nawk -F'\\t' 'BEGIN{OFS=\"\\t\"} {print $1,$3,$9}' AF316.gff &gt; seqid_type.tsv\n\n# You can also filter rows based on conditions, to retain only specific features (similar to what we can accomplish with grep)\n# Here we can filter for only CDS features\nawk -F'\\t' '$3==\"CDS\"' AF316.gff &gt; cds_features.tsv\n\n# Another thing is performing operations on the data in transit, similar to what would need a pipe and multiple commands otherwise\n# Here we can calculate the length of each CDS feature and output it as a new column\n# Consider which columns should be used to calculate the length\nawk -F'\\t' 'BEGIN{OFS=\"\\t\"} $3==\"CDS\"{print $1,$4,$5,$9,($5-$4+1)}' AF316.gff &gt; cds_features_length.tsv\n\n# Lets operate some more on the feature length file\n# Calculate the total number of CDS features and their average length\nawk -F'\\t' 'BEGIN{OFS=\"\\t\"} {total_length+=($5-$4+1); count++} END{print \"Total_CDS\",count,\"Average_Length\",total_length/count}' cds_features_length.tsv\nAwk programs can get quite complex, and we will not cover all its features here.

    "text": "3.2 Variables, for loops and if/else statements\nOur next step is to add some functionality to our script. We will start by adding variables ${VAR_NAME}, these variables can be used to store values that we can use later in the script. This is useful for storing file names, parameters, or any other values that we want to use multiple times in the script.\nExercises: Variables\n# Good variables to start with are input and output file names\n# For these variables, we typically use the full path to the file, this makes it easier to run the script from any directory\n# Swap the paths below with the correct paths to your files\nINPUT_DIR=\"path/to/data\"\nOUTPUT_DIR=\"path/to/output\"\n\n# You can also use variables to store parameters, such as the gene name pattern we want to look for in our ffn files\nGENE_NAME_PATTERN=\"gene_name\"\n\n# You can also Initialize variables to store intermediate values, such as the total number of genes matching the pattern found\nTOTAL_GENES_FOR_PATTERN=0\nBut the ffn files we have contain a multitude of gene sequences and their headers, extracting these genes across multiple files will require repeated parsing setups. This is where for loops come in, they allow us to iterate over a list of items and execute a block of code for each item in the list. In our case, we can use a for loop to iterate over a list of input files and process each file in turn.\n\n* (wildcard): A character that can be used to match any string of characters in file names or patterns\nfor: A control flow statement that allows us to iterate over a list of items and execute a block of code for each item\ndo and done: Keywords used to define the start and end of a loop block\nbasename: A command that extracts the base name of a file (the file name without the path and extension)\n~: In the context of regex, it represents the matching operator, used to check if a string matches a pattern\n\nExercises: For loops\n# Also add a creation of the counts file\necho -e \"Genome\\tGene_Count\" &gt; ${OUTPUT_DIR}/gene_counts.tsv\n\n# In our INPUT_DIR we have multiple ffn files, a good way (if you have a good structured folder) to iterate over all ffn files is to use a for loop with a wildcard\nfor ffn_file in ${INPUT_DIR}/*.ffn; do \n  # putting the wilcard alongside the file extension will match all files with that extension\n  # Inside the loop, we can use the variable ffn_file established in the loop to refer to the current file being processed\n  # Extract the base name of the file (without the path and extension) to use in the output file name\n  base_name=$(basename ${ffn_file} .ffn)\n  \n  # Use awk to extract gene sequences matching the GENE_NAME_PATTERN and save them to an output file\n  # Since we are working on a fasta file, tab-separation is not needed and all data is in one column\n  # In order to pass the pattern variable to awk, you need to figure out the flag for passing variables to awk\n  awk -v pattern=\"${GENE_NAME_PATTERN}\" 'BEGIN{OFS=\"\\t\"} /^&gt;/{if($0 ~ pattern) {print $0; getline; print $0}}' ${ffn_file} &gt; ${OUTPUT_DIR}/${base_name}_filtered.ffn\n\n  # Count the number of genes found and add it to the total\n  gene_count=$(grep -c '^&gt;' \"${OUTPUT_DIR}/${base_name}_filtered.ffn\" || true)\n  TOTAL_GENES_FOR_PATTERN=$((TOTAL_GENES_FOR_PATTERN + gene_count))\n\n  # Also store the gene count for the current file in a new file for later use \n  echo -e \"${base_name}\\t${gene_count}\" &gt;&gt; ${OUTPUT_DIR}/gene_counts.tsv\n  \n  # Echo the number of genes found in the current file to you stdout, to report progress\n  echo \"Processed ${ffn_file}, found ${gene_count} genes matching pattern '${GENE_NAME_PATTERN}'\"\ndone\nLastly, we want to add some conditional logic to our script, so that we can handle different scenarios based on the input data. This is where if/else statements come in, they allow us to execute a block of code if a certain condition is met, and another block of code if the condition is not met. We’ll also introduce one additional loop to do iterative operation on the lines of a file.\n\nif: A control flow statement that allows us to execute a block of code if a certain condition is met\nthen: A keyword used to define the start of an if block\nelse: A keyword used to define an alternative block of code if the condition is not met\nfi: A keyword used to define the end of an if block\nwhile: A control flow statement that allows us to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true\nread: A command that reads a line of input from a file or stdin\n-gt: A comparison operator that means “greater than”\n\nExercises: If/else\n# Conditional logic can be used in multiple ways, we will focus on an example where label our genomes based on the outcome of the for loop \n# To accomplish this, we will read the gene_counts.tsv file line by line and use an if/else statement to label the genomes based on the gene count\n# Now we can add some conditional logic to label our genomes\nwhile read -r line; do\n  # Read the genome name and gene count from the file\n  genome_name=$(echo \"$line\" | awk -F'\\t' '{print $1}')\n  gene_count=$(echo \"$line\" | awk -F'\\t' '{print $2}')\n\n  # Use an if/else statement to label the genome based on the gene count\n  if [ \"${gene_count}\" -gt 0 ]; then\n    label=\"label1\"\n  else\n    label=\"label2\"\n  fi\n\n  # Append the label to the metadata file\n  echo -e \"${genome_name}\\t${gene_count}\\t${label}\" &gt;&gt; \"${OUTPUT_DIR}/genomes_metadata_labeled.tsv\"\ndone &lt; \"${OUTPUT_DIR}/gene_counts.tsv\"",

    "text": "4.1 Debugging Bash Scripts: When Things Go Wrong\nBash scripts differ a bit from other programming languages (or atleast in the context you learn it, think CLI vs Spyder), in that they without configuration will continue running even if an error occurs. This can be both a blessing and a curse, as it allows for scripts to continue running even if a minor error occurs, but it can also make it difficult to identify and fix errors when they do occur. Finding and catching these errors is the other half of programming, we will now introduce a few tools that can help you debug your bash scripts.\nExercises: Global script settings\n# At the top your script we typically add set commands to define general behaviour for our script\n# These commands will most likely always be in your scripts\nset -e  # Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status\nset -u  # Treat unset variables as an error when substituting\nset -o pipefail  # Return the exit status of the last command in the pipe that failed\n\n# One additional setting is to add debugging output\n# This will print each command before it is executed, which can be useful for debugging\n# But it can also be very verbose, and clog up your output/logs\nset -x  # Enable debugging output\nThese settings can be added at the top of your script, after the shebang line (#!/usr/bin/env bash) (also add the shebang line at the top!). However, they wont help with finding the exact spot where the error occurs. One way to debug your code easily, is to use echo and create custom error messages at different stages of your script. Another way is to use traps, however we will not cover that here.\nExercises: Error messages\n# This a quite common use of if/else statements for bash scripts\n# Here is an example of a custom error message\nif [ ! -f \"$INPUT_FILE\" ]; then\n  echo \"Error: Input file $INPUT_FILE does not exist.\"\n  exit 1\nfi\nGo ahead and identify stages in the script from before where you think errors might occur, and add custom error messages where appropriate. Remember to test your script with both valid and invalid inputs to see how it behaves\n# Here are some suggestions for custom error messages: \n# You dont need to all of these if you dont want to, but if you do, make sure they are placed at the correct spots in the script\n# - Check if input and output directories exist\nif [ ! -d \"$INPUT_DIR\" ]; then\n  echo \"Error: Input directory $INPUT_DIR does not exist.\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n# and \nif [ ! -d \"$OUTPUT_DIR\" ]; then\n  echo \"Error: Output directory $OUTPUT_DIR does not exist.\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\n# Check if a name pattern is provided\nif [ -z \"$GENE_NAME_PATTERN\" ]; then\n  echo \"Error: Gene name pattern is not provided.\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\n# Print the basename of the file being processed in the for loop\n# allows you to later check that all files were processed\necho \"Processing file: ${base_name}\"\n\n# Check if any genes were found in the current file\nif [ \"${gene_count}\" -eq 0 ]; then\n  echo \"Warning: No genes matching pattern '${GENE_NAME_PATTERN}' found in ${ffn_file}\"\nfi\n\n# At the end of the script, print the total number of genes found\necho \"Total genes matching pattern '${GENE_NAME_PATTERN}': ${TOTAL_GENES_FOR_PATTERN}\"\n\n# For the while loop, check if the gene_counts.tsv file is not empty before processing\nif [ ! -s \"${OUTPUT_DIR}/gene_counts.tsv\" ]; then\n  echo \"Error: gene_counts.tsv file is empty or does not exist.\"\n  exit 1\nfi",

However, in many scenarios, we often want our scripts to be more flexible and adaptable to different inputs and options. This is where OPTARGS comes in - a built-in bash tool that allows us to easily handle command-line options and arguments. You might recognize this from the command-line tools we’ve used so far, where we can add flags like -h for help or -v for verbose output. By using OPTARGS in our scripts, we can create flags for our own programs, making them more user-friendly and versatile.\nA few key commands that we will use in this section:\n\ngetopts: A built-in bash tool for parsing command-line options and arguments\ncase statement: A control flow statement that allows us to execute different blocks of code based on the value of a variable\n\nExercises\n# To begin using OPTARGS, we need to add a while loop at the top of our script to handle the options\n# the OPTARG variable will hold the value of whatever comes after the flag in the command line\n# A while loop iterates over the options provided to the script, and sets option variables based with the read value from the command line\nwhile getopts \"i:o:p:h:\" opt; do\n  case $opt in\n    i) INPUT_DIR=\"$OPTARG\" ;;  # -i flag for input directory\n    o) OUTPUT_DIR=\"$OPTARG\" ;; # -o flag for output directory\n    p) GENE_NAME_PATTERN=\"$OPTARG\" ;; # -p flag for gene name pattern\n    h) echo \"Usage: $0 -i input_dir -o output_dir -p gene_name_pattern\"  # -h flag for help\n       exit 0 ;;\n    *) echo \"Invalid option: -$OPTARG\" &gt;&2\n       exit 1 ;;\n  esac\ndone\n\n# We can add checks to ensure that the required options are provided\nif [ -z \"$INPUT_DIR\" ] || [ -z \"$OUTPUT_DIR\" ]; then\n  echo \"Error: Input and output directories are required.\"\n  echo \"Usage: $0 -i input_dir -o output_dir -p gene_name_pattern\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\n# Its also a good idea to set default values for optional parameters, you do this in the same way as when you set variables normally\nGENE_NAME_PATTERN=\"${GENE_NAME_PATTERN:-gene_name}\"  # Default pattern if not provided\n# This sets GENE_NAME_PATTERN to the value provided by the -p flag, or to \"gene_name\" if no value is provided (as we did before)\nNow take the script you wrote before, and modify it to use OPTARGS for input and output files as well as a pattern selection OPTARGS should be placed at the top of your script, after the shebang line and global settings Remember to test your script with different combinations of options and arguments to ensure it behaves as expected",

    "text": "4.1 Containerization with Singularity\nContainers are a way to package software and its dependencies into a single, portable unit that can run consistently across different computing environments. Unlike virtual machines, containers share the host system’s kernel, making them more lightweight and efficient. This is particularly useful in bioinformatics, where software often has complex dependencies and needs to run on various systems, including high-performance computing (HPC) clusters.\nOn HPC you usually cannot sudo and may not be allowed to build images on the login/compute nodes. Best practice is then: - Build the image locally (or via a remote builder). - Copy the .sif to the HPC. - Bind-mount data and databases at runtime.",

    "text": "4.2 A minimal kraken2 Singularity definition file\nThe first step to creating a singularity container is to write a definition file. This file describes the base image, metadata, and the steps needed to install and configure the software inside the container. In many cases it will be simple, if an already hosted image exists (e.g. on BioContainers), luckily kraken2 is one of those cases. if you want to learn more about writing definition files, check out the Singularity documentation.\nCreate a file named kraken2.def with the contents below. It uses the BioContainers kraken2 image as a base.\n# kraken2.def\nBootstrap: docker\nFrom: quay.io/biocontainers/kraken2:2.1.6--pl5321h077b44d_0\n\n%labels\n    maintainer Y/N\n    org.opencontainers.image.title \"kraken2\"\n    org.opencontainers.image.source \"https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken2\"\n\n%help\n    # Help exists to provide users with information about the container.\n    # Running `singularity run-help kraken2.sif` will display this message.\n    \n    Kraken 2 in a Singularity/Apptainer container.\n    \n    Bind your database at runtime, e.g. --bind /path/to/db:/db and use --db /db.\n\n    Used for the BIO511 Genomics course at Univsersity of Gothenburg.\n\n%post\n  # Here is where you would install additional software if needed and make config changes.\n  # However, the BioContainers image already has kraken2 installed.\n\n  # But for the hell of it, put a little text file in /home\n    echo \"This is a kraken2 container built from BioContainers base image.\" &gt; /home/kraken2_info.txt\n\n    # Echo a message to indicate successful build\n    echo \"kraken2 installed.

    "text": "5.1 SLURM job script to invoke singularity container based software\nAs you already know, running software in the login node of an HPC is frowned upon. Instead, you should submit jobs to the scheduler (SLURM in this case), which allows you to take up space on one of the production nodes in the cluster. Below is a example of a SLURM job script that i (Tor) have used to run a Roary pangenome analysis on another cluster. Se if you can configure it to run kraken2 instead. All HPCs are different, so make sure to adjust paths, partitions, memory, time, etc to fit your HPC. The manual for Vera can be found here.\n#!/bin/bash -l\n#SBATCH -A nbin2-gu               # Project ID\n#SBATCH -J Roary_Pangenome        # Job name\n#SBATCH -t 20:00:00               # Time limit \n#SBATCH -n 1                      # Number of tasks (processes)\n#SBATCH -p main                   # Partition to submit to\n#SBATCH --mem=200G                # Memory per node\n#SBATCH --output=/cfs/klemming/projects/supr/naiss2024-22-639/05_PANGENOME_ANALYSIS/logs/roary_%j.out  # Standard output\n#SBATCH --error=/cfs/klemming/projects/supr/naiss2024-22-639/05_PANGENOME_ANALYSIS/logs/roary_%j.err   # Standard error\n\n# Load necessary modules (Do you need to load any modules for singularity on your HPC?)\nml singularity/4.1.1-cpeGNU-23.12\n\n# Define paths to script and container\nSINGULARITY_CONTAINER=\"/cfs/klemming/projects/supr/naiss2024-22-639/DBGWAS_test\"\"\n\n# Execute script within singularity environment\nsrun singularity exec -B /cfs/klemming/projects/supr/nbin2-gu:/mnt/data $SINGULARITY_CONTAINER roary -e --mafft -p 8 -f /mnt/data/05_PANGENOME_ANALYSIS/output/ /mnt/data/05_PANGENOME_ANALYSIS/input/*.gff\nOnce a jobscript is done, you can submit it to SLURM with the sbatch command, monitor its progress with squeue, and check the output files once its done.\nWe wont be running a jobscript for kraken2 here, but try to set one up yourself.

Run exec, shell, and run commands to ensure functionality.\nKeep containers minimal; BioContainers images are a quick and reliable base.\nUse %help and labels in your definition file; inspect with singularity run-help and singularity inspect. This helps reproducibility for other users.\nBind data with --bind host_dir:container_dir; pass multiple directories with variables\nIn some cases, you may need additional config for your runs. Instead of making complex invokes in the jobscript, consider writing a script to run the analysis, and then invoke that script within the container.",
