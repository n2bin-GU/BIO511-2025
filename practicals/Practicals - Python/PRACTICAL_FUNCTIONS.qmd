# Introduction



# Exercise

```python
# Use the exact variables defined below. Write the functions and the calls yourself.

# Provided inputs (use these)
nums = [3, -1, 7, 2, 9, 0, 4]
limit = 4
text = "Room 101: bring 2 apples & 1 banana."

# Globals to observe name masking (same-name local variables hides the global variable). Do not rename these.
count = 999
summary = "unset"
result = "unset"
```


Task:
```python
# A) Count-above  (uses nums, limit, count)
# Goal: make a small function and call it.
# 1) Define a function named count_above that takes two arguments: seq and lim.
# 2) Inside the function, create a LOCAL variable named count starting at 0.
# 3) Loop through seq; for each number strictly greater than lim, increase count by 1.
# 4) Return count.
# 5) Outside the function:
#    - Print the GLOBAL count.
#    - Call count_above(nums, limit) and print the returned number.
#    - Print the GLOBAL count again (notice the global didn’t change).
# Your code below
 


B) Text summary  (uses text, summary)
# Goal: classify characters with an if/elif/else chain and return a clear result.
# 1) Define a function named summarize_text that takes one argument: s.
# 2) Inside the function, create a LOCAL variable named summary that holds a result dictionary
#    with exactly these keys: "digits", "letters", "other" — each starting at 0.
# 3) Loop through each character in s:
#       - if the character is a digit, increase "digits"
#       - elif the character is a letter, increase "letters"
#       - else increase "other"
# 4) Return the summary dictionary.
# 5) Outside the function:
#    - Print the GLOBAL summary.
#    - Call summarize_text(text) and print the returned dictionary.
#    - Print the GLOBAL summary again.
# Your code below




#C) Aggregate with mode  (uses nums, limit, result)
# Goal: nested decisions based on a mode string. Return one final value.
# 1) Define a function named aggregate that takes three arguments: seq, mode, threshold.
# 2) Inside the function, create a LOCAL variable named result.
#    Initialize it based on mode:
#       - if mode is "sum": start at 0
#       - if mode is "count": start at 0
#       - if mode is "max": start at None (meaning “no qualifying value yet”)
# 3) Loop through each number n in seq:
#       - First, ignore n if it is negative (skip it).
#       - If n is at least threshold, then:
#           * if mode is "sum": add n to result
#           * elif mode is "count": increase result by 1
#           * else (treat any other mode as "max"):
#                 if result is None or n is greater than result, update result to n
# 4) Return result.
# 5) Outside the function:
#    - Print the GLOBAL result.
#    - Call and print each of these:
#         aggregate(nums, "sum", limit)
#         aggregate(nums, "count", limit)
#         aggregate(nums, "max", limit)
#    - Print the GLOBAL result again.
# Your Code below
