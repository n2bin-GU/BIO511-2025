# Introduction

# Exercises
## 

Create a script that:

a. Uses with open() to create a csv file with 5 rows and 5 columns. Make sure to save the file and use comma as the separator.

b. Appends a row to the file based on the users input, using argv.

##

a. Create a second script that takes the file you created in the previous task as a user defined input argument. Use argparse for this.

b. Make sure to add useful help messages to the arguments in your script.

c. use the csv module to read the csv file you created

d. Convert the data to a pandas dataframe. Print a statistical summary of your data.

Exercise — Mini FASTA toolkit with Biopython (Seq, SeqRecord, SeqIO)

Step 0 — Create the input file:
Save the text below as a file named `dna.fasta` in the same folder as your script:

>seq1
ATGCATGCATGCATGCATGCATGCATGC
>seq2
GATTACAGATTACAGATTACA
"""

###
```python
# A) Load and report (use SeqIO)

# - Read all records from `dna.fasta`.
# - For each record, print the record ID and the sequence length.
# - Also print the first 10 bases of the sequence.
```
###
```python
# B) Reverse complements to a new FASTA (use Seq, SeqRecord, SeqIO)

# - For each original record, create the reverse complement of its sequence.
# - Make a new SeqRecord for the reverse complement.
# - Set the new ID to "<oldid>_rc" and the description to "reverse complement of <oldid>".
# - Write all reverse-complement records to a file named `dna_rc.fasta`.
```

###
```python
# C) GC% annotation to a new FASTA (use SeqRecord, SeqIO)

# - For each original record, calculate GC% = 100 * (count of 'G' + count of 'C') / length.
# - Round to 1 decimal place.
# - Create a copy of the record where the description includes "GC=<value>%".
# - Write these annotated records to `dna_with_gc.fasta`.
```

###
```python
# D) Translation (Optional, do if you have extra time)

# - Translate each DNA sequence and print the first 10 amino acids.
# - Read `dna_rc.fasta` back in and confirm IDs/descriptions look correct.
```
