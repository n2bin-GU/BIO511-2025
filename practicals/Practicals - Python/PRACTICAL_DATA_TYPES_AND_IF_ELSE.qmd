# Exercises

## 1.1 Data type usage
```python
# Create a script where you save one value of each data type to its own variable.
# Afterwards, print the variables and their type using print() and type()
# Data types: integer, floating point, string, boolean, nonetype,
# list, dictionary, tuple, set, range 
```

## 1.2 If / Elif / Else on your data types



```python
# Reuse the variables you created previously in 1.1 or recreate them with new values. Print something for each part.
#   - First: check the variable’s type with type(x) is <type>.
# A) Simple check
# Pick a STRING you created. 
# If it is empty print "empty", else print "non-empty".
# (Hint: len(...) )

# Your code here


# B) Multi-way
# Pick an INTEGER you created.
# Print exactly one of: "negative", "zero", "positive".
# (Hint: compare to 0)
# Your code here


# C) Type gate + nested classification
# Pick a SEQUENCE you created (list OR tuple OR range).
# If the type matches your choice:
#   - if length == 0 → "empty"
#   - elif length == 1 → "single item"
#   - else → "multiple items"
# Else print "wrong type for this task".
# (Hint: type(x) is list/tuple/range; len(...) )
# Your code here
```
